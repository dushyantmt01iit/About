        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to My Personal Page!

Hi, I'm Dushyant Kumar, a passionate researcher, engineer, and educator. With a strong background in Mechanical Engineering, I specialize in Electrochemical Machining, and Machine Learning applications in Manufacturing. Currently, I'm pursuing my M.Tech at IIT Dharwad, where I also serve as a Teaching Assistant and Senate Member Representative.

My journey has been fueled by curiosity and a drive for excellence. From securing the 1st position in Shodhayantriki-24 to leading award-winning design and simulation projects, I have always sought to push the boundaries of knowledge. My skills span across Python, COMSOL, CATIA, Solid Edge, MATLAB, and more, enabling me to bridge the gap between theory and practical applications.

This page is a reflection of my experiences, projects, and achievements.</p>
